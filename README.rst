Hi, I'm Derek
=============

Recent graduate broadly interested in optimization, machine learning, and
scientific computing. Most of my work is in Python, although recently I've been
interested in building Python packages that mix Python and C code. See the
`c_npy_demo`__ repository that compares the runtime of a pure Python function
using `numpy`__ against an essentially identical C extension module function
using the `NumPy C API`__.

For fun, here's a toy norm-constrained convex optimization problem and a plot
of its solution against the objective's minimum. The code used to solve the
problem and generate the plot can be found in `my profile repository`__.
